# Travel-plan
As a Teaching Assistant (TA) in this project, I guided Masters' and PhD GIS students in developing travel itineraries or visit plans to points of interest for users of the location-based social network, Gowalla. The network was modeled as a directed graph, where the nodes represent user locations and the edges denote transitions between locations, such that a user moved from one location (node) at an earlier timestamp to another at a later timestamp. The edges were then weighted based on two factors: the number of users who traversed each path, and the sum of the weights of incoming and outgoing edges for each node. Since the resulting graph was disconnected, we decomposed it into connected subgraphs. From these subgraphs, we identified and selected the highest-weighted paths.
